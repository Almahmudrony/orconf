	    </a>Formal Verification with Yosys-SMTBMC</h4>
	  <p>Yosys is a free and open source Verilog synthesis tool and more.
	    It gained prominence last year because of its role as synthesis tool
	    in the "Project IceStorm" FOSS Verilog-to-bitstream flow for iCE40
	    FPGAs. This presentation however dives into the Yosys-SMTBMC formal
	    verification flow that can be used for verifying formal properties
	    using bounded model checks and/or temporal induction.
	  </p>
	  <p>The presentation covers practical examples of how to set up and use the
	    flow, but also touches on in-depth topics such as the scheme used by
	    Yosys-SMTBMC to encode a temporal circuit problem using the SMT-LIB
	    v2.5 language (utilizing uninterpreted functions and user-declared sorts).

	    <a name="zipcpu" class="anchor" href="#zipcpu"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>The ZipCPU: A resource efficient 32-bit SoftCore</h4>
	  <p>Now that FPGAs have become powerful and ubiquitous enough, there
	    exist many soft core CPUs that can be placed within FPGAs to
	    accomplish sequential tasks. Among these are the proprietary CPU's
	    Microblaze and Nios, as well as the open CPUs of OpenRISC and RISC-V.
	    These CPUs, however, tend to be built with the generic purpose of
	    turning an FPGA into a high quality CPU, rather than complementing
	    the FPGA's strength by augmenting some specialized FPGA algorithm
	    with some amount of sequential logic. This focus can be seen in both
	    the area these CPUs take up, as well as the complexity of their
	    interface to the rest of the FPGA's logic and memory.
	  </p>
	  <p>In contrast,
	    the ZipCPU has been designed from the ground up with a focus on
	    simplified logic and on-chip interaction. It does this by using a
	    stripped down instruction set, as well as a stripped down interrupt
	    and wishbone bus model. This allows the ZipCPU to fit within the
	    small spaces left over within larger designs, as exemplified by the
	    fact that it can easily fit within a Spartan-LX4, using only 1215 LUTs.

	    <a name="vlang" class="anchor" href="#vlang"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>Vlang , an Opensource Verification/Emulation Platform</h4>
	  <p>Vlang is a hardware verification DSL created on top of the D
	    programming language. It supports reasonably complex constrained
	    randomization. Vlang provides a multicore enabled port of the UVM
	    1.2 library and compiles natively to C/C++ compatible shared
	    objects/executables. Vlang has the ability to co-simulate with
	    Verilog/VHDL and SystemC simulators. It interfaces with Verilog
	    (using VPI), VHDL (using FLI) and SystemC (native) using user
	    friendly wrapper API provided as part of the library. Vlang
	    simulates the testbench in parallel (on separate threads) to the
	    Verilog/VHDL/SystemC design simulation.
	  </p>
	  <h5>Presenter: <a name="puneet" class="anchor" href="#puneet"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>Puneet Goel</h5>
	  <p>Vlang is a self-funded opensource verification language, made
	    available under generous Boost/Apache license terms. Over the past
	    four years, it has grown into more than a hundred thousand lines of
	    code (including the UVM 1.2 port). While the source code is hosted
	    on the Github, we are in the process of making an official beta
	    release in the next couple of weeks. I am the main developer of the
	    Vlang project. I have earlier published three papers on Vlang: 1.
	    Introduction to Next Generation Verification Language - Vlang --
	    DVCon 2014, Munich (link https://dvcon-europe.org/sites/dvcon-europe.org/files/archive/2014/proceedings/T5_5_paper.pdf)
	    2. A Dive into Opensource Verification Language, Vlang -- FDL 2014,
	    Munich (link http://www.ecsi.org/ressource/fdl/2014/paper/A-Dive-into-Opensource-Verification-Language-Vlang)
	    3. Vlang, a System Level Verification Perspective -- DVCon 2015,
	    Bangalore (link https://dvcon-india.org/sites/dvcon-india.org/files/archive/2015/proceedings/89_Vlang_System_Level_Verification_Perspective_paper.pdf)
	    In addition to enabling multicore parallelism in Testbenches, Vlang
	    compiles natively to object files that are ABI compatible with C
	    and to certain extent C++, thus enabling highly efficient testbenches,
	    making it an ideal platform for creating emulation testbenches. A
	    DAC 2016 University booth proposal (available on Youtube
	    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgaAP0ADcYo) expounded on a working
	    demo emulation platform. Unfortunately the demonstration (though
	    selected by SigDA for presentation) did not fructify because of US
	    Visa refusal to the university students who undertook this project.

	    <a name="openpiton" class="anchor" href="#openpiton"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>OpenPiton: A Full-Stack Open Source Manycore</h4>
	  <p>OpenPiton is an open source manycore research platform and the
	    world's first open source, general-purpose, multithreaded, manycore
	    processor. The platform is open source from the applications running
	    on Debian Linux at the top, all the way down to the RTL, ASIC/FPGA
	    synthesis scripts, and ASIC backend scripts.
	  </p>
	  <p>This talk will discuss OpenPiton's capabilities, some of the systems
	    we have built on ASIC and FPGA using the platform, and the future
	    direction of making it a baseline platform for manycore research in
	    architecture, compilers, systems, networks, EDA, programming
	    languages, and beyond.

	    </a>A fully-tested 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller in 130nm and board development</h4>
	  <p>A complete implementation and measurements of a 32-bit microcontroller
	    in a 130nm CMOS technology is presented. This is the first
	    microcontroller featuring the open source RISC-V instruction set all
	    mounted through AXI4-Lite and APB buses for communication process.
	    The microcontroller contains a 10-bit SAR ADC, a 12-bit DAC, an 8-bit
	    GPIO module, a 4kB-RAM, an SPI AXI slave interface for output
	    verification. All peripherals are controlled by a RISC-V and an SPI
	    AXI master interface that is used for programming the device and
	    checking the data flowing through all the slaves.

	    <a name="jenkins" class="anchor" href="#jenkins"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>Automating Hardware Projects with Jenkins</h4>
	  <p>Jenkins is one of the leading open-source automation servers. It’s
	    a framework, which can be adjusted to a particular area with help of
	    its flexibility and plugin system. Many open-source hardware and
	    embedded projects build their Continuous Integration and Delivery
	    flows with Jenkins, because there is not so many tools in the area.
	  </p>
	  <p>In the talk I would like to cover common use-cases of Jenkins in
	    hardware projects like integration with EDA tools and hardware
	    peripherals like FPGAs and reporting of build, test and coverage
	    reports. After that I’ll share one of two case studies about
	    integration of Jenkins into hardware projects. If I achieve something
	    presentable with the ongoing project by the conference, one of the
	    case studies will be about FuseSoC integration with Jenkins.
