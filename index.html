	  <p>We're pleased to announce that ORCONF 2016 will be held between <strong>October 7 to October 9</strong> at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unibo.it/en/university">University of Bologna</a>, in <strong>Bologna, Italy</strong>.</p>

	  <p>ORCONF is an open source digital design and embedded systems conference, covering areas of electronics from the transistor level up to Linux user space and beyond. Expect presentations and discussion on free and open source IP projects, implementations on FPGA and in silicon, verification, EDA tools, licensing and embedded software, to name a few.</p>
	  <p>Begun as the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://openrisc.io">OpenRISC</a> developers and users conference, it has become a broad open source digital design-oriented event and is supported by <a href="http://fossi-foundation.org/">FOSSi</a>, the Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The conference is free to attend, and we invite anyone with an interest in the field to participate by presenting or just joining us for the event.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Check back here over the next couple of months as we start to list the line up and event schedule.
	  </p>

	  <p>Bologna is easily accessible via air, rail and road. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Bologna#Get_in">Wikivoyage</a> has a reasonable guide on transport options.</p>
	  <p>
	    It is a city of a few-hundred thousand people, and there should be plenty of accommodation options available through the usual booking sites.

	    <a name="yosys" class="anchor" href="#yosys"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>Formal Verification with Yosys-SMTBMC</h4>
	  <p>Yosys is a free and open source Verilog synthesis tool and more.
	    It gained prominence last year because of its role as synthesis tool
	    in the "Project IceStorm" FOSS Verilog-to-bitstream flow for iCE40
	    FPGAs. This presentation however dives into the Yosys-SMTBMC formal
	    verification flow that can be used for verifying formal properties
	    using bounded model checks and/or temporal induction.
	  </p>
	  <p>The presentation covers practical examples of how to set up and use the
	    flow, but also touches on in-depth topics such as the scheme used by
	    Yosys-SMTBMC to encode a temporal circuit problem using the SMT-LIB
	    v2.5 language (utilizing uninterpreted functions and user-declared sorts).
	  </p>
	  <h5>Presenter: <a name="clifford" class="anchor" href="#clifford"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>Clifford Wolf</h5>
	  <p>Clifford Wolf is the author of Yosys, Project IceStorm, and a few
	    other FOSS projects. His interests and hobbies are FOSS EDA, formal
	    methods, data science and machine learning, GPGPUs, the game of Go,
	    and riding an electric unicycle.
	  </p>

	  <h4>
	    <a name="zipcpu" class="anchor" href="#zipcpu"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>The ZipCPU: A resource efficient 32-bit SoftCore</h4>
	  <p>Now that FPGAs have become powerful and ubiquitous enough, there
	    exist many soft core CPUs that can be placed within FPGAs to
	    accomplish sequential tasks. Among these are the proprietary CPU's
	    Microblaze and Nios, as well as the open CPUs of OpenRISC and RISC-V.
	    These CPUs, however, tend to be built with the generic purpose of
	    turning an FPGA into a high quality CPU, rather than complementing
	    the FPGA's strength by augmenting some specialized FPGA algorithm
	    with some amount of sequential logic. This focus can be seen in both
	    the area these CPUs take up, as well as the complexity of their
	    interface to the rest of the FPGA's logic and memory.
	  </p>
	  <p>In contrast,
	    the ZipCPU has been designed from the ground up with a focus on
	    simplified logic and on-chip interaction. It does this by using a
	    stripped down instruction set, as well as a stripped down interrupt
	    and wishbone bus model. This allows the ZipCPU to fit within the
	    small spaces left over within larger designs, as exemplified by the
	    fact that it can easily fit within a Spartan-LX4, using only 1215 LUTs.
	  </p>
	  <h5>Presenter: <a name="gisselquist" class="anchor" href="#gisselquist"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>Dan Gisselquist</h5>
	  <p>Dr. Gisselquist is the lead engineer and owner of Gisselquist
	    Technology, LLC, a services based company focused on providing
	    superior Computer Engineering and Signal Processing services to our
	    customers. Dr. Gisselquist has an M.S. in Computer Engineering and
	    an Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute
	    of Technology. His current work has been focused on the ZipCPU, and
	    the environment, toolsuite, and peripherals necessary to support
	    both it and any customer applications.
