	  <p>We're pleased to announce that ORCONF 2015 will be held over the weekend of <strong>October 9 until October 11</strong> at <a href="http://knowledgetransfer.web.cern.ch/ideasquare/about">Ideasquare</a>, CERN in <strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>.</p>

	  <p>ORCONF is an open source digital design and embedded systems conference, covering areas of electronics from the transistor level up to Linux user space and beyond. Expect presentations and discussion on free and open source IP projects, implementations on FPGA and in silicon, verification, EDA tools, licensing and embedded software, to name a few. Begun as the annual OpenRISC developers and users conference, it has become a general open source digital design conference. This year we broaden this approach and co-organize ORCONF with the <a href="http://lowrisc.org">lowRISC</a> workshop, both under the umbrella of the <i>Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi)</i> spirit</p>

	  <p>The event will run from <strong>13:00 until 18:30 on Friday</strong>, <strong>09:30 until 19:30 on Saturday</strong>, and from <strong>09:30 until 15:30 on Sunday</strong>. It is free to attend but you must <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/KRZux8vnyO">register</a>. Lunch will be provided both days. A dinner as a group will be arranged for the Saturday evening, and for those arriving on Thursday or Friday evening there's usually a venue nominated for pre-event drinks.</p>

	  <h4><a name="pulp" class="anchor" href="#pulp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PULP: OpenRISC-based ultra-low power parallel platform</h4>
	  <p>PULP is an open-source parallel, low-power architecture built on clusters of tightly-coupled OpenRISC ISA cores, with advanced techniques for fast performance and energy scalability. The PULP platform targets a number of high-growth application areas such as internet of Things, E-health, wearable Human-Computer interfaces. The PULP project currently involves several universities and research centers in Europe including University of Bologna, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ), Politecnico di Milano, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), and Laboratory for Electronics and Information TechnologÂ­y of Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission (CEA-LETI). This talk will describe the aims of the PULP project, and summarize its current status and plans for future evolutions of the project.</p>

	  <h5>Presenter: <a name="davide" class="anchor" href="#davide"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Davide Rossi</h5>
	  <p>Davide Rossi received the M.Sc. degree from the University of Bologna, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Bologna, in 2012, all in electronics engineering. He has been a Consultant with STMicroelectronics since 2008, where he is involved in reconfigurable architectures. He is currently post doctoral fellow at University of Bologna where he works on low-power, energy-efficienct many-core architectures.</p>

	  <h4><a name="aap" class="anchor" href="#aap"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AAP: An Altruistic Processor</h4>
	  <p>An Altruistic Processor (AAP) is a free and open source processor ISA,
	    intended as reference architecture to improve software tool chain
	    support for small, deeply embedded Harvard architectures.  These are
	    still in very widespread use (for example the Atmel AVR architecture),
	    but compiler tool chains often suffer from assuming all targets are 32-
	    or 64-bit Von Neumann RISC architectures with many registers (such as
	    ARM).</p>
	  
	  <p>AAP is a 16-bit Harvard architecture, with a 24-bit word addressed code
	    space.  It can be configured with as few as four 16-bit registers and
	    has an extensible instruction set offering 16-bit, 32-bit and longer
	    instructions.  It thus provides a robust test of the generality of
	    modern compiler tool chains.</p>
	  
	  <p>Embecosm has implemented a LLVM tool chain and instruction set simulator
	    for AAP, and is in the process of creating FPGA implementations in
	    Verilog for the DE0-Nano.</p>
	  
	  <p>In this talk, we will explain in detail the feature and philosophy of
	    AAP as well as some software features we aim to improve through this
	    project.  We will present the implementation of both the ISS and the
	    FPGA designs, one of which is a simple student implementation, and the
	    other a superscalar pipelined implementation.</p>
