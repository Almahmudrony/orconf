	  <p>
	    We're pleased to announce that ORCONF 2016 will be held between <strong>October 7 to October 9</strong> at
	    the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unibo.it/en/university">University of Bologna</a>, in
	    <strong>Bologna, Italy</strong>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    ORCONF is an open source digital design and embedded systems conference, covering areas of
	    electronics from the transistor level up to Linux user space and beyond. Expect presentations
	    and discussion on free and open source IP projects, implementations on FPGA and in silicon,
	    verification, EDA tools, licensing and embedded software, to name a few.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>Begun as the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://openrisc.io" target="_blank">OpenRISC</a> developers and
	    users conference, it has become a broad open source digital design-oriented event and is
	    supported by <a href="http://fossi-foundation.org/" target="_blank">FOSSi - the Free and Open Source
	    Silicon Foundation</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    The conference is free to attend, and we invite anyone with an interest in the field to
	    participate by presenting or just joining us for the event.

	    </a>Open-source Hardware: Opportunities and Challenges</h4>
	  <p>
	    Innovation in hardware is slowing due to rising costs of chip design and diminishing beneﬁts
	    from Moore’s law and Dennard scaling. Software innovation, on the other hand, is ﬂourishing,
	    helped in good measure by a thriving open-source ecosystem. We believe that open source can
	    similarly help hardware innovation, but has not yet due to several reasons. We identify these
	    reasons and how the industry, academia, and the hardware community at large can come together
	    to address them. <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.01980v2.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE Computer paper</a>.

	    <a href="https://twitter.com/boom_cpu" target="_blank">BOOM</a> is an open source superscalar
	    out-of-order RISC-V core that is roughly equivalent in performance
	    and area to a Cortex A9 or A15 processor. BOOM supports the full RV64G RISC-V ISA (including the
	    Privileged and External Debug specifications), provides good single-thread performance competitive with
	    contemporary processors, is written in a free and open hardware construction language (Chisel), targets
	    both ASIC and FPGA flows, and is accompanied by an open source design specification.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In this talk we will discuss some of the latest updates to BOOM and the larger Rocket-chip SoC ecosystem
	    that BOOM integrates with. We will also discuss the new Chisel3 hardware construction language and its
	    new FIRRTL-based (a <strong>F</strong>lexible <strong>IR</strong> for <strong>RTL</strong>) flow, which
	    helps open up the world of writing compiler passes to hardware designers for fun and profit.

	    </a>Formal Verification with Yosys-SMTBMC</h4>
	  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> is a free and open source Verilog synthesis tool and more.
	    It gained prominence last year because of its role as synthesis tool

	    verification flow that can be used for verifying formal properties
	    using bounded model checks and/or temporal induction.
	  </p>
	  <p>The presentation covers practical examples of how to set up and use the
	    flow, but also touches on in-depth topics such as the scheme used by
	    Yosys-SMTBMC to encode a temporal circuit problem using the SMT-LIB
	    v2.5 language (utilizing uninterpreted functions and user-declared sorts).

	    </a>PULP: an open source Parallel Ultra-Low-Power computing platform</h4>
	  <p><a href="http://www.pulp-platform.org/" target="_blank">PULP</a> is a RISC-V
	    based multi-core platform that leverages near-threshold computing
	    and multi-core parallelism to provide high performance and energy efficiency while
	    maintaining the flexibility and programmability typical of instruction processors to
	    target requirements of a number of high-growth near-sensor processing Internet of
	    Things (IoT) applications.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    PULP supports OpenMP, OpenCL, and OpenVX parallel programming models on top of GCC
	    and LLVM toolchains. A virtual platform allows early application development and debug,
	    while a RTL cycle accurate Xilinx Zynq-based FPGA emulation platform with support for
	    debug and instruction tracing is available for development and benchmarking of
	    real-life applications. An expansion board for Zynq integrating several sensors,
	    including low power imagers, MEMS microphones, and accelerometers, has been developed
	    to emulate real-life application environments. Multiple silicon implementations of
	    PULP have been taped out in several technology nodes and achieve hundreds of GOPS/W on
	    video, audio, inertial sensor data processing and classification, within power envelopes
	    of a few milliwatts. PULP hardware and software are open-source with the goal of supporting
	    and boosting an innovation ecosystem focusing on ULP computing for the IoT.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The purpose of this talk is to present recent evolutions of PULP to the ORCONF community,
	    with the goal of sharing the hardware/software PULP infrastructure, as well as silicon
	    prototypes and application boards.

	    <a name="zipcpu" class="anchor" href="#zipcpu"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
	    </a>The ZipCPU: A resource efficient 32-bit SoftCore</h4>
	  <p>Now that FPGAs have become powerful and ubiquitous enough, there
	    exist many soft core CPUs that can be placed within FPGAs to
	    accomplish sequential tasks. Among these are the proprietary CPU's
	    Microblaze and Nios, as well as the open CPUs of OpenRISC and RISC-V.
	    These CPUs, however, tend to be built with the generic purpose of
	    turning an FPGA into a high quality CPU, rather than complementing
	    the FPGA's strength by augmenting some specialized FPGA algorithm
	    with some amount of sequential logic. This focus can be seen in both
	    the area these CPUs take up, as well as the complexity of their
	    interface to the rest of the FPGA's logic and memory.
	  </p>
	  <p>In contrast,
	    the <a href="http://opencores.org/project,zipcpu" target="_blank">ZipCPU</a> has been designed from the ground up with a focus on
	    simplified logic and on-chip interaction. It does this by using a
	    stripped down instruction set, as well as a stripped down interrupt
	    and wishbone bus model. This allows the ZipCPU to fit within the
	    small spaces left over within larger designs, as exemplified by the
	    fact that it can easily fit within a Spartan-LX4, using only 1215 LUTs.

	    RF (FPRF) transceiver, Altera Cyclone IV FPGA with ~40K logic elements, plus a Cypress USB 3.0

	    FPGA RTL and Cypress FX3 firmware all provided under liberal licensing, together with an accompanying

	  <p>
	    The LimeSDR board is also very close in architecture to another Myriad-RF design, the STREAM FPGA development

	    (required for e.g. timing critical cellular systems). However, there is also the potential for implementing
	    many other capabilities in the FPGA, in order to offload the host processor, enable support for new
	    applications and perhaps even enable standalone use.

	    LimeSDR is a project developed via the <a href="https://myriadrf.org/about/" target="_blank">Myriad-RF initiative</a>, for which I am the community manager.

            </a>Open SoC Debug: Bringing up a flexible, scalable
            debugging framework</h4>
          <p>System-on-Chip are more and more complex and finding
	    functional errors (bugs) or performance bottlenecks can be
	    very time-consuming and frustrating. The well-known
	    methodology of gdb-like run-control debugging is limited
	    when it comes to observation of a running SoC to discover
	    concurrency problems and other effects. Trace debugging
	    has gained importance, where the processor and other SoC
	    components emit trace events during execution.</p>

	    <p>Even though debug infrastructure is an essential part
	    of any SoC design, most people consider creating it more
	    of a necessary chore than an exciting endeavor and
	    especially for open source projects a good debug
	    infrastructure is often not considered important
	    enough.</p>

	    <p>We have started <a href="http://opensocdebug.org">Open
	    SoC Debug</a> as a flexible frmework of hardware building
	    blocks and the software infrastructure to ease the
	    deployment of modern, scalable debug in your SoC.</p>

	    <p>This talks gives an overview of our goals and the state of
	    the project. I will demonstrate examples of the
	    integration in
	    the <a href="http://lowrisc.org">lowRISC</a> project and
	    the <a href="http://optimsoc.org">OpTiMSoC</a> project.</p>
