	  <p>We're pleased to announce that ORCONF 2015 will be held over the weekend of <strong>October 9 until October 11</strong> at <a href="http://knowledgetransfer.web.cern.ch/ideasquare/about">Ideasquare</a>, CERN in <strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>.</p>

	  <p>ORCONF is an open source digital design and embedded systems conference, covering areas of electronics from the transistor level up to Linux user space and beyond. Expect presentations and discussion on free and open source IP projects, implementations on FPGA and in silicon, verification, EDA tools, licensing and embedded software, to name a few.</p>
	  <p>Begun as the annual <a href="http://openrisc.io">OpenRISC</a> developers and users conference, it has become a broad open source digital design-oriented event. This year ORCONF is run as a <em>Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi)</em> event, further broadening its remit, and as such will include a <a href="http://lowrisc.org"><strong>lowRISC</strong></a> workshop on the Friday.</p>

	  <p>The event will run from <strong>13:00 until 18:30 on Friday</strong>, <strong>10:00 until 19:30 on Saturday</strong>, and from <strong>09:30 until 15:30 on Sunday</strong>. It is free to attend but you must <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/KRZux8vnyO">register</a>. Lunch will be provided both days. A dinner as a group will be arranged for the Saturday evening, and for those arriving on Thursday or Friday evening there's usually a venue nominated for pre-event drinks.</p>

	  <h4><a name="pulp" class="anchor" href="#pulp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PULP: OpenRISC-based ultra-low power parallel platform</h4>
	  <p>PULP is an open-source parallel, low-power architecture built on clusters of tightly-coupled OpenRISC ISA cores, with advanced techniques for fast performance and energy scalability. The PULP platform targets a number of high-growth application areas such as internet of Things, E-health, wearable Human-Computer interfaces. The PULP project currently involves several universities and research centers in Europe including University of Bologna, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ), Politecnico di Milano, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), and Laboratory for Electronics and Information Technolog­y of Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission (CEA-LETI). This talk will describe the aims of the PULP project, and summarize its current status and plans for future evolutions of the project.</p>

	  <h5>Presenter: <a name="davide" class="anchor" href="#davide"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Davide Rossi</h5>
	  <p>Davide Rossi received the M.Sc. degree from the University of Bologna, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Bologna, in 2012, all in electronics engineering. He has been a Consultant with STMicroelectronics since 2008, where he is involved in reconfigurable architectures. He is currently post doctoral fellow at University of Bologna where he works on low-power, energy-efficienct many-core architectures.</p>

	  <h4><a name="aap" class="anchor" href="#aap"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AAP: An Altruistic Processor</h4>
	  <p>An Altruistic Processor (AAP) is a free and open source processor ISA,
	    intended as reference architecture to improve software tool chain
	    support for small, deeply embedded Harvard architectures.  These are
	    still in very widespread use (for example the Atmel AVR architecture),
	    but compiler tool chains often suffer from assuming all targets are 32-
	    or 64-bit Von Neumann RISC architectures with many registers (such as
	    ARM).</p>
	  
	  <p>AAP is a 16-bit Harvard architecture, with a 24-bit word addressed code
	    space.  It can be configured with as few as four 16-bit registers and
	    has an extensible instruction set offering 16-bit, 32-bit and longer
	    instructions.  It thus provides a robust test of the generality of
	    modern compiler tool chains.</p>
	  
	  <p>Embecosm has implemented a LLVM tool chain and instruction set simulator
	    for AAP, and is in the process of creating FPGA implementations in
	    Verilog for the DE0-Nano.</p>
	  
	  <p>In this talk, we will explain in detail the feature and philosophy of
	    AAP as well as some software features we aim to improve through this
	    project.  We will present the implementation of both the ISS and the
	    FPGA designs, one of which is a simple student implementation, and the
	    other a superscalar pipelined implementation.</p>

	  <h4><a name="xeonfpga" class="anchor" href="#xeonfpga"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Xeons + FPGA and enabling Open Source third party IP</h4>
	  <p>Gaurav Kaul discusses the use of accelerators on Intel platforms to deliver better performance efficiency for targeted workloads. He addresses the use of FPGAs as a programmable accelerator and the recent trend of leading cloud service providers and telco service providers investigating the use of FPGA accelerators for differentiation and customization.</p> 
	  <p>The discussion also covers Intel’s recent announcement of the Xeon+FPGA integrated product concept and presents our plans to bring this concept to market. We will also discuss how this will enable 3rd party IP vendors to have a wider reach by putting their IP on Xeon+FPGA platform.</p>

	  <h4><a name="yosys" class="anchor" href="#yosys"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Source HDL Synthesis and Verification with Yosys</h4>
	  <p><a href="http://www.clifford.at/yosys/">Yosys</a> (Yosys Open Synthesis Suite) is an open source project aiming at
	    creating a fully-featured HDL synthesis tool, and more. Lately a lot of
	    features related to formal verification have been added to Yosys.</p>

	  <p>Project IceStorm aims at documenting the bit-stream format of Lattice iCE40
	    FPGAs and providing simple tools for analyzing and creating bit-stream
	    files, including a tool that converts iCE40 bit-stream files into Verilog.</p>

	  <p>Arachne-PNR is a place&amp;route tool based on the databases provided by
	    Project IceStorm. It converts BLIF files into an ASCII file format that can
	    be turned into a bit-stream by IceStorm tools.</p>

	  <p>This three projects together implement a complete open source tool-chain
	    for iCE40 FPGAs. It is available now and it is feature complete (with the
	    exception of timing analysis, which is work in progress).</p>

	  <p>This presentation covers the open source Yosys-IceStorm-Arachne iCE40 flow
	    as well as some other synthesis and verification applications based on
	    Yosys.</p>

	  <h5>Presenter: <a name="clifford" class="anchor" href="#clifford"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="http://www.clifford.at/">Clifford Wolf</a></h5>
	  <p>Clifford Wolf is the author of Yosys and Project IceStorm, among other open
	    source projects. He is probably best known for being the original author
	    of <a href="http://www.openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a>. His open source lib(X)SVF library somehow made it into the
	    field bus system used in CERN's LHC (CernFIP).</p>

	  <h4><a name="shakti" class="anchor" href="#shakti"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shakti RISC-V processors</h4>
	  <p><a href="http://rise.cse.iitm.ac.in/shakti.html">SHAKTI</a> is a family of processors based on the RISC-V ISA and targets all the major segments
of the processor spectrum, ranging from IoT class controllers to server/HPC class server parts.
One of the class in series of processors, the I-Class is aimed at mobile and desktop environments. The design is highly parametrized  to facilitate quick design space exploration. It is an Out-of-Order core, with pipeline depth of 8 stages, based on merged register file approach.</p>

	  <p>Another class of series of processors, the F-Class, employs ECC to tolerate errors in registers and memories and uses space and time redundancy based techniques to tolerate errors in ALU.</p>

	  <p>In this talk, we will present the design and performance characteristics of I-Class processor and fault tolerant techniques employed in ALU of the F-Class.</p>
